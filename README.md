<h1>Capstone Project</h1>

<h4>Idea</h4>

<p>
The idea of the project was to take an older project, Past-Tents, and adapt it to use a Django back-end and a React front-end.
The goal of the project is to institute the technologies that were unable to be implemented in the previous project.
</p>

<h4>Technologies</h4>

<p>The technologies that are going to be used are Django with the following modules:
-Pillow (for image uploading)
-Djangorestframework-simplejwt (for token authentication)
-Djangorestframework (for CRUD functionality)

In addition, using GoogleAuth to create users without having to refer to the database.
</p>

<h4>User Stories</h4>
<p>-I would like a website where I can share my camping experiences in the locations I've camped.
-I would like to be able to not have to create an user account to log in.
